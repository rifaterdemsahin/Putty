# Putty Hands-On Implementation

## Introduction
This guide provides a hands-on implementation of using PuTTY, a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console, and network file transfer application.

## Prerequisites
- Download and install PuTTY from the [official website](https://www.putty.org/).
- Basic understanding of SSH and terminal commands.

## Steps

### 1. Launch PuTTY
- Open PuTTY by double-clicking the executable file.

### 2. Configure Connection
- In the "Session" category, enter the hostname or IP address of the remote server in the "Host Name (or IP address)" field.
- Ensure the "Port" field is set to `22` for SSH connections.
- Select "SSH" as the connection type.

### 3. Save the Session (Optional)
- In the "Saved Sessions" field, enter a name for your session.
- Click "Save" to store the session configuration for future use.

### 4. Connect to the Server
- Click "Open" to initiate the connection.
- If this is your first time connecting to the server, you will see a security alert. Click "Yes" to proceed.

### 5. Authenticate
- When prompted, enter your username and password for the remote server.

### 6. Using the Terminal
- Once authenticated, you will have access to the remote server's terminal.
- You can now execute commands as if you were directly logged into the server.

## Common Commands
- `ls` - List directory contents.
- `cd` - Change directory.
- `pwd` - Print working directory.
- `mkdir` - Create a new directory.
- `rm` - Remove files or directories.

## File Transfer with PuTTY
- Use `pscp` (PuTTY Secure Copy) to transfer files between your local machine and the remote server.
- Example: `pscp localfile.txt user@remotehost:/path/to/remote/directory`

## Conclusion
This guide covered the basic steps to connect to a remote server using PuTTY and perform common tasks. For more advanced usage, refer to the [PuTTY documentation](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/htmldoc/).

To exclude specific files from being tracked by Git, you can use a `.gitignore` file. Here is how you can do it:

1. **Create or open a `.gitignore` file** in the root directory of your repository.

2. **Add the file paths or patterns** you want to exclude. For example:

    ```plaintext
    # Exclude specific files
    /workspaces/Putty/Symbols/terraform-aws-ec2/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.73.0/linux_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.73.0_x5
    ```

3. **Save the `.gitignore` file** and commit the changes:

    ```bash
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Add files to .gitignore"
    ```

4. **Push the changes** to your remote repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

This will ensure that the specified files are excluded from being tracked by Git.

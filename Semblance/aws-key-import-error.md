To solve the "Invalid base64" error when importing an SSH key pair to AWS, you need to ensure that the public key is correctly formatted and encoded in base64. Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Check the Public Key Format**: Ensure that your public key is in the correct format. It should start with `ssh-ed25519` followed by the base64-encoded key and an optional comment.

2. **Convert the Public Key to Base64**: If your public key is not already base64-encoded, you can convert it using the following command in a Unix-based system:
   ```sh
   cat id_ed25519.pub | base64
   ```

3. **Remove Newline Characters**: Ensure that the base64-encoded key does not contain any newline characters. You can use the `tr` command to remove newlines:
   ```sh
   cat id_ed25519.pub | base64 | tr -d '\n'
   ```

4. **Import the Key Pair**: Use the AWS CLI to import the key pair with the correctly formatted and encoded public key:
   ```sh
   aws ec2 import-key-pair --key-name "id_ed25519" --public-key-material "$(cat id_ed25519.pub | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully import your SSH key pair to AWS without encountering the "Invalid base64" error.

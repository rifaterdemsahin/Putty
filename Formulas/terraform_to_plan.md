# Terraform Apply Prerequisites

Before running `terraform apply`, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. **Install Terraform**: Make sure Terraform is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

2. **Configure AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS CLI with your credentials. You can follow the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

3. **Create a Terraform Configuration File**: Write your Terraform configuration in a `.tf` file. This file will define the resources you want to create.

4. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` in your project directory to initialize the working directory containing the Terraform configuration files.

5. **Validate Configuration**: Run `terraform validate` to check the syntax and configuration.

6. **Plan the Deployment**: Run `terraform plan` to create an execution plan and review the changes that will be made.

# Connecting to AWS

To connect Terraform to AWS, create a file named `provider.tf` with the following content:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
    region     = "us-west-2"  # Replace with your desired region
    access_key = "your_access_key"  # Replace with your AWS access key
    secret_key = "your_secret_key"  # Replace with your AWS secret key
}
```

Alternatively, you can use environment variables to set your AWS credentials:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
```

Make sure to replace `"your_access_key"` and `"your_secret_key"` with your actual AWS credentials.

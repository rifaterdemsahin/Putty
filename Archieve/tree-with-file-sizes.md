To display a file tree with file sizes, you can use the `tree` command with the `-h` option. Here's an example of how you can document this in your markdown file:

```markdown
# File Tree with Sizes

To display a file tree with file sizes, use the following command:

```sh
tree -h
```

This will output a directory tree with file sizes in a human-readable format. For example:

```
.
├── [4.0K]  dir1
│   ├── [1.2K]  file1.txt
│   └── [2.3K]  file2.txt
└── [3.4K]  dir2
    ├── [1.1K]  file3.txt
    └── [2.2K]  file4.txt
```
```
```

This command is useful for quickly visualizing the structure of a directory and the sizes of the files within it.
